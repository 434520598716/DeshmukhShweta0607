Ranking of Test Cricket player using PCA and Weighted Moving Average

Abstract:-

Now days, cricket is the most popular sport worldwide. To chose best team for a cricket match, 
measuring each player's performance is essential. As cricket is team game, team's performance 
is dependent on the performance of its members. Due to the interrelated nature of the variables 
used to assess cricket players' contributions to their team, performance analysis is always a 
challenging. This study uses principal component analysis and the weighted average approach to 
compute player performance based on several batting and bowling-related metrics. The 
International Cricket Council's dataset for bowlers and batters can be used for this analysis. This 
study used principal component analysis to rank the players according to their contribution.
In the previous study, first principal component was used to rank test cricket players. However, 
the first main component accounts for nearly 60% of the variation in both the datasets. The 
datasets don't vary enough for us to assert that our approach is effective for ranking. We can get 
around this problem by using the weighted average method. In this approach, the first three 
principle components must be taken into account before creating a combined principal 
components model, which accounts for close to 90% of the variation in two datasets.
